# Me Chat

## What is this application?

MeChat is a personal project I have been working on since April 2024, at the end of my first work term. It simulates a chat room server where users can connect and send messages to one another. Firebase integration allows for user authentication, and Firestore allows for persistence of user messages for maintaining state. Currently, this application supports a universal chatroom where all users can send and receive messages. Future plans for MeChat include the ability to create multiple chatrooms, offering users more flexibility and options for communication, and even more depending on what I learn in school and industry.

# Why did I create this application?

The concept for MeChat originated from a Python application I built last summer in preparation for my Distributed Computing course, which utilized direct TCP sockets and a GUI module for a basic chat server experience. I want this project to represent the evolution of my skills as a programmer. By working on MeChat, I've showcased my progression from creating a simple Python application to developing a more complex and feature-rich web application using modern technologies like Vue.js, Firebase, and Firestore, which I have learned over the past year through my work term and personal learning. MeChat is a personal testament to my growth and continuous learning in programming and software development, reflecting my commitment to building robust applications and applying what I've learned in my academics and industry experience. I plan on growing MeChat even further as I continue to learn and develop my skills as a programmer. You can still find the original Python program I created in my networking repository if you want to see how it has evolved.
